poem1 = Poem.create(title: "One Wish", description: "She hid behind her flawless faÃ§ade,
    I had hoped to catch a glimpse,
    Of her auburn hair and freckled cheeks,
    Pretty eyes and lips,
    When I had her in my sights,
    I told her sheâ€™d been missed,
    Then I held her hand in mine,
    And leaned in for a kiss,
    She reciprocated my advancement,
    And there was momentary bliss,
    Then I whispered in her ear,
    Sheâ€™d granted my one wish ")
poem2 = Poem.create(title: "To an unread poet.", description: "I used to read your poems,
    but lately you don't write,
    you're silent and aloof,
    you know that isn't right.
    You can't close a door once opened,
    you can't abolish all your dreams,
    you're a poet of the heart,
    mustn't fall apart at the seams.
    Say what you can in words,
    they speak the message true,
    spoken from the heart,
    the poems will see you through.
    A hermit's not your style,
    a recluse, you are not,
    never give up writing,
    of things that you've been taught.
    I used to read your poems,
    I'd read them once again,
    if you would send them out,
    (this one's from a poet friend")
